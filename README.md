# Riwa Hoteit

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m Riwa, a software engineer who loves blending creativity with technology.  
I enjoy building immersive experiences, experimenting with new ideas, and sharing my journey along the way.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring anime, working on a game, or trying out something new in design.

## 🚀 Projects
A few highlights from what I’ve worked on:

- **Beirut Restaurant Platform** – full-stack mobile app for discovering restaurants with GPT-powered recommendations  
- **Static Bloom** – a personal Unity horror game project inspired by atmospheric storytelling  
- **Discord Bot (Discord4J)** – my first project! Taught me how to really read documentation and sparked my love for coding  
- **Notion-Revolut Integration** – automated financial tracking by syncing Revolut transactions into Notion

## ✍️ Blogs
I like writing about what I’m building and learning:
- Designing a narrative puzzle-platformer where silence and motion tell the story  
- Building a bridge between Notion and Revolut for financial tracking  
- First steps into coding through a Discord bot project

## 🏠 A Special Element
Instead of a traditional portfolio, I also created an **interactive 3D house**.  
Visitors can explore it room by room to uncover projects, interests, and a bit of my personality.  
It’s playful, creative, and a different way to show what I love working on.
