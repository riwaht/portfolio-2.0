## 🎯 What Makes This Special

Instead of a traditional portfolio website, I created an **interactive 3D house** that visitors can explore room by room. Each space tells part of my story - from professional projects displayed on the PC, to personal interests scattered throughout the rooms.

**What You'll Experience:**
- 🏡 Walk through a custom-designed 3D house
- 🎮 Interactive guided tour with 19 unique steps
- 💻 Click on objects to discover projects and interests
- 🎵 Relaxing background music from Pixar's "UP"
- 📱 Seamless experience on desktop and mobile
- 🌙 Beautiful lighting that adapts to each room

## ✨ Key Features

**3D House Experience**
- Custom house model designed in Blender
- Interactive objects throughout each room
- Smooth camera movements between areas
- Dynamic lighting for each space

**Guided Walkthrough**
- 19-step interactive journey
- Visual highlights show what to click
- Progress tracking with sound effects
- Option to skip for returning visitors

**Mobile Optimized**
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive design for all devices
- Optimized performance on phones/tablets

**Built With**
- **React** - Modern frontend framework
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and animations
- **Vite** - Fast build system
- **Vercel** - Deployed with global CDN for speed

## 🚀 Why This Approach?

As a software engineer, I wanted to showcase both **technical skills** and **creativity**. This portfolio demonstrates:

- **3D Development**: Complex 3D graphics and animations in the browser
- **User Experience Design**: Intuitive, engaging interactions 
- **Mobile Development**: Responsive design that works everywhere
- **Performance Engineering**: Fast loading despite rich 3D content
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Turning a traditional portfolio into an experience

*The site is optimized for speed with lazy loading, efficient 3D rendering, and global CDN deployment.*

## 🎮 Try It Yourself

**Live Demo:** [riwashouse.live](https://riwashouse.live)

The experience takes about 5-10 minutes to complete, or you can explore freely after the guided tour.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] More animations and transitions between rooms
- [ ] Enhanced 3D visual design and materials
- [ ] Advanced physics interactions with objects
